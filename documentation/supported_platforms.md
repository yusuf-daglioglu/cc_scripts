# SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

Currently, all functions only tested on:

- bash 5.0.17 (on Ubuntu 20.04 & Fedora)
- zsh 5.8 (on Ubuntu 20.04 & Fedora)
- MinGW (using GitBash on Windows 10 & 11)
- Windows Subsystem Linux (Ubuntu) - Does not work

Most of the functions call third party commands (like grep, cat, curl, ipconfig...). These commands are not bundled with this project.
